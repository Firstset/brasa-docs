# What is Brasa

Brasa is a liquid staking protocol built on Fogo that enables users to stake
their tokens while maintaining liquidity and earning competitive yields.

## Protocol Overview

Brasa transforms traditional staking by issuing liquid staking tokens (LST) that
represent staked positions. This allows users to earn staking rewards while
using their capital productively across DeFi.

### Core Components

**Staking Contract**

- Handles deposits and withdrawals
- Manages validator delegations
- Calculates exchange rates
- Distributes rewards

**brsToken (LST)**

- ERC-20 compatible token
- Represents staked position + rewards
- Freely transferable and composable
- Value increases over time

**Validator Network**

- Curated set of high-performance validators
- Diversified for security and uptime
- Monitored continuously
- Subject to performance criteria

**Governance**

- Multi-signature control
- Time-locked operations
- Community proposals
- Transparent execution

## How It Works

### Staking Flow

```
User Stakes → Tokens Delegated to Validators → brsToken Minted → Rewards Accrue → Value Increases
```

1. **Deposit**: User deposits tokens into Brasa contract
2. **Delegation**: Tokens are delegated to validator network
3. **Issuance**: brsToken minted at current exchange rate
4. **Rewards**: Validators earn staking rewards and MEV
5. **Distribution**: Rewards increase brsToken exchange rate
6. **Withdrawal**: User can redeem brsToken anytime

### Exchange Rate Mechanism

The brsToken exchange rate is calculated as:

```
Exchange Rate = Total Staked Tokens / Total brsToken Supply
```

As rewards accrue, the numerator increases, making each brsToken worth more base
tokens over time.

**Example:**

- Day 1: 1 brsToken = 1.000 tokens
- Day 365: 1 brsToken = 1.075 tokens (7.5% APR)

## Key Features

<Callout type="success">
  **Instant Liquidity**: No lock-up periods or withdrawal queues (liquidity
  permitting)
</Callout>

### Transparent Operations

All protocol operations are on-chain and verifiable:

- Validator delegations
- Reward distributions
- Fee collection
- Governance actions

### Composable LST

brsToken integrates seamlessly with DeFi protocols:

- Trade on DEXs
- Use as collateral for lending
- Provide liquidity in AMM pools
- Stake in yield farms

### Optimized Yields

Brasa maximizes returns through:

- Validator performance optimization
- MEV reward capture and distribution
- Efficient gas management
- Strategic delegations

### Institutional Grade Security

Multi-layered security approach:

- Audited smart contracts
- Multi-signature governance
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Continuous monitoring

### Validator Selection

Validators are selected based on:

- Historical performance (uptime >99.5%)
- Infrastructure quality
- Competitive commission rates
- Reputation and track record
- Geographic diversity

See [Validator Requirements](/validators/requirements) for details.

## Comparing Approaches

| Feature         | Traditional Staking | Brasa LST        |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Liquidity       | Locked              | Liquid           |
| Transferable    | No                  | Yes              |
| DeFi Composable | No                  | Yes              |
| Rewards         | Manual claim        | Automatic        |
| Minimum         | Often high          | Low (0.1 tokens) |
| Unstaking Time  | Days/weeks          | Instant\*        |

\*Subject to liquidity availability
