  <Tab title="Smart Contract">
    Advanced users can interact directly with the smart contracts:

    <ContractAddress
      chain="Fogo"
      address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
      label="Brasa Staking Contract"
    />

    ```solidity
    // Example: Stake tokens
    function stake(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256 shares);

    // Example: Unstake tokens
    function unstake(uint256 shares) external returns (uint256 amount);
    ```

      provider: window.ethereum,
      network: 'fogo'
    })

    // Stake tokens
    const tx = await brasa.stake('1000')

## What Happens Next?

After staking, your tokens immediately begin earning rewards:

### Reward Accrual

- **Staking Rewards**: Earned from validator operations
- **MEV Rewards**: Distributed proportionally to all stakers
- **Compound Effect**: brsToken value increases over time relative to the
  underlying token

### Tracking Your Position

Monitor your staking position through:

- **Web App Dashboard**: Real-time balance and rewards
- **On-Chain**: View transactions on Fogo explorer
- **Portfolio Trackers**: Many DeFi dashboards support brsToken

<Callout type="success">
  **Congratulations!** You're now staking with Brasa. Your rewards accrue
  automatically—no need to claim or compound manually.
</Callout>

## Using Your brsToken

Your brsToken is fully liquid and composable. You can:

- **Hold**: Simply hold and earn staking rewards
- **Trade**: Exchange on DEXs at current market rate
- **DeFi**: Use as collateral or in liquidity pools
- **Transfer**: Send to any Fogo address

See [LST Economics](/concepts/lst-economics) to understand brsToken value
dynamics.

## Unstaking

When you want to exit your position:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Unstake">
    Navigate to the unstake section in the web app
  </Step>

<Step title="Enter Amount">Enter the amount of brsToken to unstake</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Transaction">
  Review and confirm the unstake transaction
</Step>

  <Step title="Receive Tokens">
    Receive your original tokens plus accrued rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Note**: Unstaking is subject to liquidity availability. In most cases, it's
  instant, but during high demand, there may be a short waiting period.
