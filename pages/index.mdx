# Welcome to Brasa Docs

Brasa is a liquid staking protocol on Fogo that provides transparent operations,
MEV rewards, and institutional-grade security for your staked assets.

## What is Brasa?

Brasa is a liquid staking token (LST) protocol built on Fogo that allows you to:

- **Stake** your assets and earn staking rewards
- **Maintain liquidity** with transferable LST tokens
- **Earn MEV rewards** from validator operations
- **Verify transparency** through on-chain operations
- **Trust institutional-grade security** with comprehensive audits

## Features

### Transparent Operations

All validator operations, rewards, and fees are visible on-chain. Track your
staking rewards in real-time.

### MEV Rewards

Benefit from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) rewards earned by Brasa's validator
network.

### Composable LST

Use your brsToken across DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards.

### Institutional Security

Multi-signature governance, comprehensive audits, and battle-tested smart
contracts.
