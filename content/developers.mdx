# Developers

Developers can integrate with Brasa through the SPL Stake Pool deployment on
Fogo. stFOGO is implemented as a standard SPL Token, making it compatible with
existing Solana tooling and infrastructure.

## Source Code

Fogo's Stake Pool deployment is a fork of the canonical SPL Stake Pool program
with modifications to support the Fogo blockchain and its features. The source
code and SDKs are available on GitHub:
