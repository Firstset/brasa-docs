# Security & Audits

Security is a top priority at Brasa Finance. We leverage battle-tested
infrastructure and maintain rigorous security standards through multiple layers
of audits and responsible disclosure programs.

## SPL Stake Pool Program

Brasa Finance operates as a pool created within a SPL Stake Pool deployment on
Fogo. The SPL Stake Pool program forms the foundation of our infrastructure and
has undergone extensive security review by multiple leading security firms.

All SPL Stake Pool audits can be found in the
[Anza security audits repository](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits?tab=readme-ov-file#stake-pool).

## Fogo-Specific Modifications

The deployment on Fogo includes additional modifications made by
[Firstset AG](https://firstset.xyz) to support the Fogo blockchain and its
account abstraction SDK
([Fogo Sessions](https://docs.fogo.io/fogo-sessions.html)). These modifications
have been independently audited by [Neodyme](https://neodyme.io/en/), a leading
blockchain security firm.

Neodyme has conducted 4 independent audits of the canonical SPL Stake Pool
program and has also audited the Fogo-specific modifications, providing
comprehensive security coverage across the entire stack.

## Bug Bounty Program

Brasa Finance operates a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure
of security vulnerabilities. We welcome security researchers and white hat
hackers to help us maintain the highest security standards.

If you discover a security vulnerability that could lead to loss of funds,
please report it to:

**security@brasa.finance**

Bounties will be awarded at the team's discretion based on the severity and
impact of the disclosed vulnerability. We are committed to working with security
researchers to quickly address any issues and protect our users.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that security researchers:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for us to address the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or accessing user funds
- Act in good faith to protect our users and the protocol

Thank you for helping keep Brasa Finance secure.
