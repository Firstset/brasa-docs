# Overview

Welcome to Brasa, the liquid staking protocol on Fogo. This guide will help you
understand what Brasa is and how it works.

## What is Liquid Staking?

Liquid staking allows you to stake your tokens while maintaining liquidity.
Instead of locking up your assets, you receive liquid staking tokens (LST) that
represent your staked position.

### Key Benefits

- **Earn Staking Rewards**: Receive validator rewards while your assets are
  staked
- **Maintain Liquidity**: Use your LST tokens across DeFi protocols
- **No Lock-up Period**: Transfer or trade your position at any time
- **Compound Returns**: Earn additional yield by using LST in DeFi
