# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Brasa liquid staking protocol.

## General Questions

### What is Brasa?

Brasa is a liquid staking protocol on Fogo that allows you to stake tokens while
maintaining liquidity. You receive brsToken (Brasa's LST) that represents your
staked position and can be used across DeFi.

### How does liquid staking work?

When you stake tokens through Brasa:

1. Your tokens are delegated to validators
2. You receive brsToken representing your position
3. Staking rewards automatically accrue to brsToken value
4. You can use, trade, or hold brsToken
5. Redeem brsToken anytime to get your tokens back

### Is Brasa safe?

Brasa implements multiple security measures:

- Comprehensive security audits by top firms
- Multi-signature governance with timelock
- Battle-tested smart contracts
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Transparent on-chain operations

See [Security](/security/audits) for details.

## Staking Questions

### What are the minimum and maximum stake amounts?

- **Minimum**: 0.1 tokens (to cover gas costs)
- **Maximum**: No upper limit

### How long does staking take?

Staking is immediate. Once your transaction confirms, you receive brsToken and
start earning rewards.

### Can I unstake anytime?

Yes, unstaking is permissionless and typically instant, subject to liquidity
availability.

### Is there an unstaking period?

No lock-up period. However, during high demand, you may need to wait for
liquidity to be available. Most unstakes are instant.

## Rewards Questions

### How much can I earn?

Rewards vary based on:

- Base validator rewards (typically 4-8% APR)
- MEV rewards (typically 0.5-2% additional)
- Network conditions

Current rates are shown on [app.brasa.finance](https://app.brasa.finance).

### How are rewards distributed?

Rewards accrue automatically through the exchange rate mechanism. The value of
brsToken increases relative to the base token over time.

You don't need to claim or compoundâ€”rewards are built into your brsToken
balance.

### What are MEV rewards?

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) rewards come from optimal block production by
validators. Brasa validators share these rewards with stakers.

Learn more in [LST Economics](/concepts/lst-economics).

## brsToken Questions

### What is brsToken?

brsToken is Brasa's liquid staking token. It represents your staked position
plus accrued rewards.

### How does brsToken value work?

brsToken is a rebasing token where:

- Initial rate: 1 brsToken = 1 token
- Value increases as rewards accrue
- Exchange rate reflects total rewards earned

Example: If you stake 100 tokens today and the protocol earns 10% over a year,
your 100 brsToken will be redeemable for 110 tokens.

### Where can I use brsToken?

brsToken is composable across Fogo DeFi:

- DEXs and AMMs for trading
- Lending platforms as collateral
- Liquidity pools for additional yield
- Any DeFi protocol that accepts ERC-20 tokens

### Can I transfer brsToken?

Yes, brsToken is a standard token and fully transferable.

## Fees Questions

### What fees does Brasa charge?

Brasa has a transparent fee structure:

- **Protocol Fee**: 10% of staking rewards
- **No** deposit fees
- **No** withdrawal fees
- **No** performance fees

## Risk Questions

### What are the risks?

Key risks include:

- **Smart Contract Risk**: Bugs or vulnerabilities in code
- **Validator Risk**: Slashing or poor performance
- **Liquidity Risk**: Delays during high unstake demand
- **Market Risk**: Token price volatility

See [Risks and Disclosures](/concepts/risks-and-disclosures) for detailed
discussion.

### What is slashing?

Slashing is a penalty applied to validators for malicious behavior or extended
downtime. Brasa mitigates this by:

- Carefully selecting validators
- Diversifying across multiple validators
- Monitoring performance continuously

### Is brsToken price stable?

brsToken value should equal or exceed the base token value (due to rewards).
However, market trading prices may fluctuate based on supply/demand.

### What if the protocol gets hacked?

Brasa has multiple safeguards:

- Multi-signature controls
- Time-locks on critical operations
- Emergency pause functionality
- Insurance considerations (under evaluation)

## Validator Questions

### How do I become a Brasa validator?

See [Validator Requirements](/validators/requirements) for detailed criteria and
application process.

### How are validators selected?

Validators are selected based on:

- Performance history
- Infrastructure quality
- Commission rates
- Alignment with protocol goals

See [Validator Operations](/validators/operations).

### What is the validator commission?

Commission rates vary by validator but are transparently published. Brasa
targets a blended rate of 5-10%.
