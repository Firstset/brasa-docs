# Fees & Unstaking

## Unstaking Methods

stFOGO can be instantly converted back to FOGO through two primary methods, each
with different characteristics to suit your needs.

### 1. Native

Withdraw directly from the protocol using the pool's reserves:

- **Speed**: Instant
- **Slippage**: None - you receive the exact exchange rate
- **Capacity**: Limited to 1% of total pool value (TVL)
- **Rebalancing**: Reserves are replenished every epoch to ensure sufficient
  liquidity
- **Best for**: Quick exits when reserve capacity is available

The 1% reserve is carefully maintained to balance instant liquidity with capital
efficiency. After significant withdrawals, the reserve is automatically refilled
during the next epoch rebalancing.

### 2. DEX

Swap stFOGO for FOGO on decentralized exchanges like
[Valiant](https://valiant.trade):

- **Speed**: Instant
- **Slippage**: Subject to market conditions and liquidity depth
- **Capacity**: No limit - depends on DEX liquidity
- **Fee**: Slightly higher than in-protocol withdrawals due to DEX trading fees
- **Best for**: Large withdrawals exceeding reserve capacity or when reserves
  are temporarily depleted (until the next epoch rebalance)

DEX liquidity typically remains robust, ensuring you can exit your position at
any time regardless of reserve availability.

## Fee Structure

Brasa maintains a transparent and straightforward fee structure designed to
sustain protocol operations while keeping costs minimal for users.

### Staking Rewards Commission

**10%** commission on staking rewards earned by the pool

- Supports protocol development and maintenance
- Covers validator infrastructure costs
- Funds ongoing security audits and improvements
- You still earn **90%** of all staking rewards

### Deposit Fee

**0%** fee on deposits

- No cost to stake your FOGO
- No barriers to entering the protocol

### Withdrawal Fee

**0.2%** fee on withdrawals

This small fee serves an important security function. Without it, attackers
could exploit a timing edge case to extract yield from the pool:

1. Deposit right before rewards are distributed
2. Immediately withdraw after rewards are claimed
3. Capture a portion of other users' rewards without staking

The 0.2% withdrawal fee makes this attack economically unviable, protecting the
pool and its participants. For more technical details, see the
[SPL Stake Pool documentation on fees](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/stake-pool/fees#stake-deposit--withdraw).

## Summary

| Action                        | Fee            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Deposit FOGO → stFOGO         | 0%             |
| Hold stFOGO (earning rewards) | 10% of rewards |
| Withdraw stFOGO → FOGO        | 0.2% (native)  |

The fee structure is designed to be competitive while ensuring long-term
protocol sustainability and security.
