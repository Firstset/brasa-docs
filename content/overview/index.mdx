# Overview

Brasa is a liquid staking protocol built on Fogo that enables users to stake
their FOGO tokens while maintaining liquidity through stFOGO. By staking with
Brasa, you earn rewards from Fogo's validator network while retaining the
flexibility to use your tokens in DeFi applications.

The protocol automatically manages stake distribution across validators,
maintains reserves for instant withdrawals, and provides a seamless staking
experience with gasless transactions.
