# stFOGO

stFOGO is Brasa's liquid staking token (LST) that represents your staked FOGO in
the Brasa pool. Each stFOGO token is fully backed by staked reserves,
automatically compounds rewards, and is composable across the Fogo DeFi
ecosystem.

## Key Properties

### Fully Backed

Every stFOGO token is backed by staked FOGO in the Brasa staking pool. Your
tokens represent a real claim on staked assets that are actively earning rewards
from Fogo validators.

### Auto-Compounding

Unlike traditional staking tokens that maintain a 1:1 peg, stFOGO automatically
accrues rewards, meaning its value increases over time relative to FOGO. Each
stFOGO represents a share in the pool that steadily grows as staking yield is
earned.

For example:

- Today: 1 stFOGO = 1.05 FOGO
- One month later: 1 stFOGO = 1.08 FOGO
- Six months later: 1 stFOGO = 1.20 FOGO

The exchange rate increases as the underlying staked FOGO earns rewards, which
are automatically reflected in the value of your stFOGO holdings.

### Composable & Redeemable

stFOGO is a standard SPL token, making it fully composable in DeFi applications
and redeemable at any time through multiple methods (see
[Fees & Unstaking](/overview/fees-unstaking)).

## DeFi Integrations

stFOGO's composability unlocks multiple ways to generate additional yield on top
of your staking rewards:

### Decentralized Exchanges

Use stFOGO on DEXes such as [Valiant](https://valiant.trade) to:

- **Trade positions**: Buy or sell stFOGO based on market conditions
- **Arbitrage the peg**: Profit from price discrepancies between stFOGO and FOGO
- **Earn LP yield**: Provide liquidity to stFOGO/FOGO pools and earn trading
  fees on top of your staking yield

### Lending Platforms

Leverage stFOGO in lending protocols such as [Pyron](https://pyron.fi) and
Fogolend to:

- **Borrow against stFOGO**: Use your stFOGO as collateral while your staking
  yield offsets borrow costs
- **Loop positions**: Borrow FOGO against stFOGO, stake it for more stFOGO, and
  repeat to amplify your staking yield exposure

### Future Integrations

The Brasa ecosystem is continuously growing with new DeFi integrations. As more
protocols adopt stFOGO, additional utility and yield opportunities will become
available.
