# Brasa Protocol

## What is Brasa?

Brasa is a liquid staking protocol built on [Fogo](https://www.fogo.io) that
enables users to stake their FOGO tokens while maintaining liquidity. By staking
with Brasa, you receive stFOGO tokens that represent your staked position,
allowing you to:

- **Earn staking rewards** without locking up your assets
- **Use stFOGO in DeFi** to generate additional yield on top of staking rewards
- **Maintain liquidity** while your FOGO continues earning rewards

## Liquid Staking

Traditional staking requires you to lock your tokens, making them unavailable
for other uses. Liquid staking solves this by issuing you a liquid token
(stFOGO) that represents your staked position. This means you can:

- Trade your staked position on decentralized exchanges
- Use it as collateral in lending protocols
- Provide liquidity in DeFi pools
- Transfer it to other wallets

All while your underlying FOGO continues earning staking rewards.

## Staking Infrastructure

The protocol stakes its FOGO across the Fogo validator set, ensuring your stake
contributes to the network's security and decentralization.

### Delegation Strategy

Brasa currently employs an equal distribution strategy across all
well-performing validators in the network. This approach:

- Promotes network decentralization
- Reduces concentration risk
- Supports a diverse validator ecosystem

### Reserve Management

To enable instant withdrawals, the protocol maintains a reserve of unstaked
FOGO:

- **Target**: 1% of total value locked (TVL)
- **Rebalancing**: Automatically adjusted every epoch
- **Epoch duration**: Currently 1 hour (subject to change as the network
  evolves)

The reserve ensures sufficient liquidity for users to instantly withdraw their
FOGO without waiting for unstaking periods.

## Key Features

### Gasless Staking

Brasa offers a seamless staking experience with gasless transactions, allowing
you to stake in the most user-friendly way possible while paying no gas fees.

### Dynamic Rebalancing

The protocol automatically distributes stake across zones and validators to
maintain even balance across the network's economic security, requiring no
manual intervention from users.

## Team

Brasa is built and operated by [Firstset](https://firstset.xyz), a staking lab
and early contributor to Fogo. Firstset has been participating as a validator on
the Fogo network since Genesis, bringing deep expertise in validator operations
and network security to the protocol.
